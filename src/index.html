            Three-tier Architecture
          </h4>
          This is a software design pattern that divides an application into three separate layers, each with distinct responsibilities. The presentation tier handles user interface elements and user interactions, ensuring a seamless user experience. The application or business logic tier processes data, enforces business rules, and manages application functionality. Meanwhile, the data storage tier manages data storage, retrieval, and database interactions. This modular approach enhances scalability, maintainability, and security, as changes in one tier don't necessarily impact others. By separating concerns, the three-tier architecture facilitates efficient development and management of complex applications.

          <h4>
            Microservices Architecture
          </h4>
          This is a software design approach where applications are composed of small, independent services that communicate through well-defined APIs. Each service focuses on a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. This architecture promotes flexibility, allowing different services to be written in different programming languages and using various technologies. Microservices enable rapid development, easy maintenance, and better resource utilization, as services can be scaled individually based on demand. However, managing the complexity of service interactions and ensuring effective communication between services are key challenges in this architecture.

          <h4>
            Command Line Interface (CLI) Architecture
          </h4>
          This refers to the design of software applications that interact with users through text-based commands in a command-line environment. In this architecture, users input commands and arguments to execute specific tasks or operations. CLI applications are often lightweight, fast, and well-suited for tasks like system administration, automation, and scripting. The architecture focuses on processing user inputs, executing commands, and providing textual outputs. CLI applications can be developed in various programming languages and offer a straightforward way to interact with complex systems without the need for graphical interfaces.

          <h4>
            Software as a Service (SaaS)
          </h4>
          This is a cloud computing model where software applications are provided to users over the internet on a subscription basis. In this architecture, users access the software through web browsers, eliminating the need for local installations or maintenance. SaaS offers convenience, as users can access the software from any device with an internet connection. It also simplifies updates and maintenance, which are handled by the service provider. SaaS applications range from productivity tools like email and collaboration software to more specialized solutions. This model reduces upfront costs and allows businesses to focus on using the software rather than managing infrastructure.
