  Why are prefixes at the beginning and suffixes at the end of a word anyways?

Second, believe it or not it has a lot todo with navigating a car through a system of gotchas in order to reach some destination. 
Where a driver interprets the road and tells the car how to move while a navigator interprets the map and tells the driver what to do.  
<br />
<br />
<div class="terminal-card">
  <header>symantic</header>
  <div>
    how words, phrases, and sentences convey meaning within a language.
  </div>
</div>
<br />
The gotcha here is that the car is moving at speed and everyone needs to plan the timing of their commands just right so that there is no miscommunication between passengers. 
<br />
<br />
<div class="terminal-card">
  <header>word</header>
  <div>
    a packet of text that bridges the gap between abstract things and physical concepts; it has a meaning and that meaning has a usage. 
  </div>

For a pragmatic demonstration lets say that at the end of every word is a road network intersection or (space) where a turn can be made and between each letter is an address or (character) where another turn can be made.
Now, if we are moving at speed which of the following options is the most correct.
<ol class="upper-alpha">
  <li>A: turn right at the light<br /></li>
  <li>B: at the light turn right<br /></li>
  <li>C: in 100 feet turn right<br /></li>
  <li>D: make a right turn</li>
</ol>
<div class="terminal-card">
  <header>syntax</header>
  <div>
    the rules and pricipals that govern the structure of sentences in a language. 
    it defines how words are related and combined in order to form meaningful sentences.
  </div>
</div>
<br />
Obviously there is no one correct answer because it is a bit of a mix.
3 -> C is just a reminder to an upcoming event.
However 1 -> A is wrong because it gets confusing for the driver to hear "turn right" first because they might think it is an emediate turn such as 4 -> D. 
So 2 -> B is right because it is best to give a location or (noun) first and then the direction or (verb adverb) second for correctness.

  So that covers how and where but what happens if there is an accident?

Third, after all we are working on the -ware or (pottery) of things. 
However before we start defining our flow-based scripting language we are going to add some muddy clairity to the already steep learning curve of inomlang.
<br />
<br />
<div class="terminal-card">
  <header>logic</header>
  <div>
    sequences of reasoning, between valid and invalid arguements, in order to reach corectness from question through inference and then to answer.
  </div>
</div>

Starting with some tables we are going to cover working with clay or (interpreting), firing clay or (compiling), and clay use cases or (runtime).
We are going to cover all 6 investigation occurances then conclude in summory our 1 inom constant which represents orthagnal relationship.

Here is another thought experiment about prefixes and suffixes. Consider your first and last name for a second and ask yourself why existental comes before universal.
