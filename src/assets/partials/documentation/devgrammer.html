  What is a subvind? 
</blockquote>
I started out with my full name "Travis Burandt" and found common letters between my first name and my last name. This happens to be the letters t, r, and a. So I removed those letters because they cancel out, similar to math where values get canceled out on opposite sides of the equal sign, I did the same. Such that I was left with the name "vis bund"; then I joined the two words together and formed a new word = subvind or underwind.

  Why are things priced the way they are?

It took me 3 full months working full time to complete our first µSaaS product erpnomy. If you were to go hire someone with a similar title you'd end up paying them around 120k a year. So you are getting a 3 month project (a 30k product) for $19 a month. Plus it's free for startups. Which is honestly a great deal.
<br />
<br />
<h4 id="branding-removal">Branding Removal</h4>
The decision to undertake branding removal from our µSaaS products was made to create a more cohesive and white-label experience for our clients, allowing them to customize the software with their own organization's identity.

  <div>
    The suffix "-nomy" is derived from the Greek word "nomos," which means "law," "custom," or "management." When added to the end of a word, it forms nouns that typically refer to a system, science, or study of a particular subject or field. These words are often used to describe the principles, rules, or governance of that subject.
