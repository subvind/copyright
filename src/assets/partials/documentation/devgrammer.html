Hello, my name is subvind and I am your friendly neighbor. My main tasks are devgrammer, flow-based, and full-stack. How may I help you today?

  What is a devgrammer? 
</blockquote>
First, we have to start with what is a programmer. Which is a person who writes computer programs.
Ok we know what writing and computers are but that still doesn't tell us what a gram or a pro is. 
If fact the prefix pro- means, "in favor of"; and the suffix -gram means, "a record, writing". 
All together we can say a programmer is someone that is in favor of a record, writing.
<br />
<br />
<div class="terminal-card">
  <header>record</header>
  <div>
    a thing constituting a piece of evidence about the past, especially an account kept in writing or some other permanent form.
  </div>
</div>
<br />
Which is great because we can sit here and name writing techniques all day.
Such as paper, pencil, or eraser. How about pen or perminant marker. 
In either case the syntax used when writing facts down is going to be different between situations.
For example, when a mistake is made in pencil things can be undone however in other methods a scratch maybe the only way to make corrections.
<br />
<br />
Given any set of tools your output will be limited by the capabilities of said tools.
So give a man a shovel he digs a hole. 
Give a man digging machine he digs a trench.
Therefor, in a sense, we can say the better the tools the better the project.

      <th>reference</th>
      <th>state</th>
      <th>continuum</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="4">
        event driven: unlike a predetermined sequence of instructions events are about waiting, dispatching, handling, and loop returns. 
      </th>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>\</th>
      <td>past</td>
      <td>ordered</td>
      <td>space</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>|</th>
      <td>present</td>
      <td>processing</td>
      <td>space</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>/</th>
      <td>future</td>
      <td>random</td>
      <td>space</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>.</th>
      <td>now</td>
      <td>past, present, and future</td>
      <td>time</td>

Consider a scinario where you only have spinning plates. 
Perhaps some read & write hard drives or perhaps some vinyl on a turn table. 
Once again when it comes to making corrections to the record we are left with undo and scratching.  
<br />
<br />
<div class="terminal-card">
  <header>develop</header>
  <div>
    grow or cause to grow and become more mature, advanced, or elaborate.  
 </div>
</div>
<br />
Now we can start to break down what a devgrammer actually is. 
The key here is presorvation because it's not like plates vs paper where one is better than the other.
They are both art.
One uses a ball point while the other a flat sphere. 
What we are mainly intested in is obtaining and observing an acurate historical log of the facts. 
The right tool for the right job. It's not about one tool being better or (pro) than the other. 
It's about growing and progressing or (dev) existing records and new records with the right tools using the right skillsets; it is about devgramming.
