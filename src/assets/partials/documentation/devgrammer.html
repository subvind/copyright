<blockquote cite="">
  What is a subvind? 
</blockquote>
I started out with my full name "Travis Burandt" and found common letters between my first name and my last name. This happens to be the letters t, r, and a. So I removed those letters because they cancel out, similar to math where values get canceled out on opposite sides of the equal sign, I did the same. Such that I was left with the name "vis bund"; then I joined the two words together and formed a new word = subvind or underwind.

<h4 id="pricing">Pricing</h4>
<blockquote cite="">
  Why are things valued and priced the way they are?
</blockquote>
It is based on 40-60 hours a week of work at 10K a month starting from July 2023. For instance: It took me 3 full months working full time to complete a MVP for our first µSaaS product erpnomy. If you were to go hire someone with a similar title you'd end up paying them around 120k a year. So you are getting a 3 month project (a 30k product) for $19 a month. Plus it's free for startups. Which is honestly a great deal.
<br />
<br />
<h4 id="white-label">White Label</h4>
The decision to undertake branding removal from our µSaaS products was made to create a more cohesive and white-label experience for our clients, allowing them to customize the software with their own organization's identity.
<br />
<br />
<h4 id="license">License</h4>
Licenses allow developers to run a fork of our subvind git codebase which grants full access to all our products. The binifit here is that developers get to use their own servers and modify the code as they see fit.
<br />

<h4 id="branding">Branding</h4>
With names like erpnomy and homenomy you will be sure to find what your looking for when searching with unique keywords.

  <header>nomy</header>
  <div>
    The suffix "-nomy" is derived from the Greek word "nomos," which means "law," "custom," or "management." When added to the end of a word, it forms nouns that typically refer to a system, science, or study of a particular subject or field. These words are often used to describe the principles, rules, or governance of that subject.
