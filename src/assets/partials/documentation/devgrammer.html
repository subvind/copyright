<blockquote cite="">
  What is a subvind? 
</blockquote>
I started out with my full name "Travis Burandt" and found commen letters between my first name and my last name. This happens to be the letters t, r, and a. So I removed those letters because they cancel out, similar to math where values get canceled out on oposite sides of the equal sign, I did the same. Such that I was left with the name "vis bund"; then I joined the two words together and formed a new word = subvind.

I remember the coding interview at AA was to write a function that accepts a string, reverses it, and returns a string. It makes total sense branding wise as to why AA would ask this question. I thought it was clever. That is why I named inam something that was algrithmic.
