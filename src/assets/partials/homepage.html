  <h4>
    Mission Statement
  </h4>
  Hello There!
  <br />
  Thank you for taking the time in reviewing us for your consideration.
  <br />
  <br />
  Websites are like sail boats. They require a main haul or backend API. They require a main mast or frontend interface. When put together and under the right wind-conditions/user-interations your boat/project can successfully navigate to it's destination.
  <br />

  </blockquote>
  Say hello to underwind.solutions: where your project is not just another website; because we treat your project as if it were a high end yacht. We're not as expensive as you might think though, as we only charge per request. So no wind-under-you-sails/user-interactions then no movement/charge.
  <br />
  <br />
  Therefore, the better user experience we create, the more user-interactions your website will get, thus the more profit we can both make. 
  <br />
  <br />
  A wind wind situation :)
  <br />
  <br />
  kind regards,
  <br />
