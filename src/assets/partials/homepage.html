  A dangerous place to get some flow-based devgramming done.
  <br />
  <br />
  <h4>
    Mission Statement
  </h4>
  To do the things that one wants to do. To explore areas of language, code, and blueprints. To work hard on things that need to be worked on. To challenge oneself to achieve greater. To fall asleep knowing that an impact was made. To become a fully autonomous full-stack developer and beyond.
  <br />
  <br />
  <h4>
    Project Goals
  </h4>
  1) a lexer, parser, and interpreter that transpiles (<a href="https://github.com/subvind/inomlang">inomlang</a> + autoide) into a new project based on a node.js template that can be deployed to production.
  <br />
  <br />
  2) a devgrammer <a href="https://github.com/subvind/ucimecu">portfolio</a> in 100% plain old html, css, and javascript.
  <br />
  <br />
  3) a backend <a href="https://github.com/subvind/isisis">server</a> that manages ERP database records in PostgreSQL, user notifications and member 2 member personal messaging in RabbitMQ, and integrates with 3rd parties like stripe for payments and twilio for sms.
  <br />
  <br />
  4) a frontend <a href="https://github.com/subvind/autoide">client</a> that has an admin area for managers and a products area for customers. it looks like a mobile app but it runs on the web.
  <br />
  <br />
  <h4>
    Target Audience
  </h4>
  Someone that is interested in flow-based programming with a developer mindset. They think in terms of nodes, anchors, and edges. They have an itching desire to make impovements. They are interested in seeing their code visually through diagram technology when it comes to building a program; yet, terminal user interfaces are their friend.
