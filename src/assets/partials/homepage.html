  A dangerous place to get some flow-based devgramming done.
  <br />
  <br />
  <h4>
    Mission Statement
  </h4>
  To do the things that one wants to do. To explore areas of language, code, and blueprints. To work hard on things that need to be worked on. To challenge oneself to achieve greater. To fall asleep knowing that an impact was made. To become a fully autonomous full-stack developer and beyond.
  <br />
  <br />
  <h4>
    Project Goals
  </h4>
  1) a text parser that converts code or <a href="https://github.com/subvind/inomscript">inomscript</a> to runnable rustlang for flow-based devgramming.
  <br />
  <br />
  2) a devgrammer <a href="https://github.com/subvind/ucimecu">portfolio</a> in 100% plain old html, css, and javascript.
  <br />
  <br />
  3) a backend <a href="https://github.com/subvind/isisis">server</a> that manages database records, quorum queues via asynchronous messaging, and inomscript package manager.
  <br />
  <br />
  4) a frontend <a href="https://github.com/subvind/autoide">client</a> that is diagram based, that is terminal based, and runs locally.
  <br />
  <br />
  <h4>
    Target Audience
  </h4>
  Someone that is interested in flow-based programming with a developer mindset. They think in terms of nodes, anchors, and edges. They have an itching desire to make impovements. They are interested in seeing their code visually through diagram technology when it comes to building a program. Terminal user interfaces are their friend.
  <br />

  <h4>
    How to use
  </h4>
  Verify <a href="https://nodejs.org">node.js</a> package manager:
  <pre>$ npm --version</pre>
  Then install this <a href="https://github.com/subvind/inomscript">scripting language</a>:
  <pre>$ npm install --global inom</pre>
  Read the manual for <a href="/">documentation</a>:
  <pre>$ inom --help</pre>
  Deploy this <a href="https://github.com/subvind/isisis">runtime</a> backend to the internet:
  <pre>https://github.com:subvind/isisis</pre>
  Download this <a href="https://github.com/subvind/autoide">desktop IDE</a> frontend:
