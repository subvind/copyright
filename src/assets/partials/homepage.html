  A dangerous place to get some flow-based devgramming done.
  <br />
  <br />
  <h4>
    Mission Statement
  </h4>
  To do the things that one wants to do. To explore areas of language, code, and blueprints. To work hard on things that need to be worked on. To challenge oneself to achieve greater. To fall asleep knowing that an impact was made. To become a fully autonomous full-stack developer and beyond.
  <br />
  <br />
  <h4>
    Project Goals
  </h4>
  0) a top <a href="https://github.com/subvind/ucimecu">devgrammer</a> portfolio in 100% plain old html, css, and javascript.
  <br />
  <br />
  1) a stream <a href="https://github.com/subvind/entropy">entropy</a> as an interesting water fountain except in pixels.
  <br />
  <br />
  2) a backend <a href="https://github.com/subvind/FlowERP">server</a> coded in nest.js that manages ERP database records in PostgreSQL, event-driven microservices with RabbitMQ, and integrates well with 3rd party APIs like stripe for payments and twilio for sms.
  <br />
  <br />
  3) a frontend <a href="https://github.com/subvind/CommandERP">client</a> which is an ERP admin area for employees; because the backend is headless all customer facing content is done on it's own CMS.
  <br />
  <br />
  4) a sync <a href="https://github.com/subvind/inomlang">inomlang</a> lexer, parser, and interpreter that converts a strings of text (blocks of custom code formatted in xml, cli, ts, or json) and compiles them into a running script.
  <br />
  <br />
  5) a base <a href="https://github.com/subvind/autoide">autoide</a> for visualizing business logic in a diagram format; easily picture how ERP events are triggered, such as customer created or order recieved, and then handled throughout the system.
  <br />
  <br />
  6) a cli <a href="https://github.com/subvind/inom">inom</a> for setting up user/project and for importing/exporting data in and out of user/project.
  <br />
  <br />
  7) a tv <a href="https://github.com/subvind/flowtube">flowtube</a> with playlists that cover everything subvind.
  <br />

  <h4>
    Target Audience
  </h4>
  Someone that is interested in flow-based programming with a developer mindset. They think in terms of nodes, anchors, and edges. They have an itching desire to make impovements. They are interested in seeing their code visually through diagram technology when it comes to building a program; yet, terminal user interfaces are their friend.
  <br />
  <br />
  <h4>
    How to use
